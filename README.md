# Podcast Application

## Overview
This project is an application for a podcast library where you can access podcasts across multiple platforms. Our target audience is aimed towards anyone with a mobile device who listens to podcasts with the typical demographic being people from 12-32 years old. We chose a podcast application as we all have a general interest in podcasts and wanted to create an application to centralize and retrieve your favorite podcasts.
